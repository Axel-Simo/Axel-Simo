HOW TO CALCULATE CGPA

List of grades:
A = 4
B = 3
C = 2
D = 1
F = 0

1. Each course gets one of the 5 grades.
2. The CGPA is calculated by summing the grades in the courses and 
   then divided by the total number of courses.

a. Have a file containing constants: The grades will be an enum GRADES in that file
b. A function that returns the CGPA: it receives the list of course.

Possible improvements:
The app can receive a file of students in a table with courses as columns
and grades for each student under in each row
c. We may need a function to handle file opening and closing
